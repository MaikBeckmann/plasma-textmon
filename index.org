The very basics you need to try and error your way efficently to the goal.

* [[file:dataengines.html][Plasma data engines]]
The main script of a plasma applet is run exactly once.  For being come back at
you have to tell plasma what data you want and how often.

* [[file:textmon-0_1-tweak-guide.html][Hacking TextMon-0.1]]
A number of examples on how to alter TextMon-0.1 are presented.

* The next thing
The actual point of TextMon is to give you an hands-on hacking entry point to
writing plasma applets.  While starting to document TextMon I've learned a lot
new things, which aren't reflected in TextMon-0.1 .  There are new and foremost
much simpler flavors TextMon to come, like
  - TextMonCpu
  - TextMonMem
  - TextMonWlan
  - TextMonSda
etc.  Eventually I'll come back to this original applet.  The code will most
like be much simper, easier to understand and tweak.

There you'll find the applet sources, the [[http://github.com/MaikBeckmann/plasma-textmon/tree/gh-pages][sources]] for this documentation (emacs
.org files) and an installable .plasmoid file in the [[http://github.com/MaikBeckmann/plasma-textmon/downloads][download]] sction.
