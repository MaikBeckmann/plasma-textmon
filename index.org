TextMon is /Do It Yourself/ textual system monitor, meant to be an entry point
for coding kde plasma applets in Javascript.

* Getting started
Go to the [[http://github.com/MaikBeckmann/plasma-textmon/downloads][download]] section, get =textmon.plasmoid= and install it via
 : % plasmapkg -i textmon.plasmoid
Now [[http://userbase.kde.org/Plasma#Widgets][add the widget]] called 'TextMon' to the desktop or panel.

You most likely want to tweak the settings. This is done by editing the [[http://github.com/MaikBeckmann/plasma-textmon/blob/master/textmon/contents/code/main.js][source
code]]. The settings dialog shows you how to get there (right click the applet).
Here a number of examples on how to customize TextMon
 - [[file:hacking-textmon.html][Hacking TextMon]]

The rest of the document is about writing TextMon from scratch.

* [[file:prelude.html][Development prelude]]
The first step in a new devlopment environment is to get a simple message on the screen
 : hello world!
The predude shows you how to do exactly that with a stand alone Javascript
interpreter as well as with a plasma applet written in Javascript.  Along the
way you'll be shown the traps waiting for you to step into and how to avoid
them.

* [[file:dataengines.html][Plasma data engines]]
The main script of a plasma applet is run exactly once.  To get another chance
of doing something you have to tell plasma why and how often.  The answer to
the "why" is always the same: data.

* [[file:ui-basics.html][Plasma user interface basics]]
A few basics that cover all our needs.  There aren't much, since the only two
UI widgets we'll use are labels, a layout to arrange them and the applet
itself.

* [[http://github.com/MaikBeckmann/plasma-textmon][github repo]]
There you'll find the applet sources and the [[http://github.com/MaikBeckmann/plasma-textmon/tree/gh-pages][sources]] for this documentation
(emacs .org files).
