#+Title:A minimalistic textual system monitor.

By default it shows
- total cpu load
- used application memory
- wlan down and up rate
- sda read and write rate

You most likely want to tweak the settings. This is done by editing the source
code. The settings dialog shows you how to get there.

This hacky way of configuring the applet is no shortcoming but by intention. I
plan to write up a little guide/tutorial which shows how to write this applet
from scratch in Javascript. Stay tuned :D

This is also a tribute to the awesome window manager, where doing such a system
monitor widget is among the first things you learn. I've came to appreciate
knowing exactly when my system comes under pressure (cpu, mem, sda) or if a
download is still going (wlan).
